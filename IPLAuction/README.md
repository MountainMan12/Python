## Python Program to generate IPL teams 

### 1. FEATURES
- Given a player database containing their attributes and price for auctioning
- Players are randomly samples into each team based on the sampling constraints provided in the config.txt file
- Maximum 18 players are allowed per team

### 2. SCOPE
- If a team exceeds the allotted budget an error message will be displayed.
- A player can be auctioned for a unique attribute (e.g. Batsman, Bowler, Wicket-Keeper of all-rounder)

### 3. CONSTRAINTS
- If excess players are sampled, the players removed can violate the pre-defined constraints in the config.txt file
- Prior removal of duplicated rows causing sampling error
- Every team has the same budget which is not necessary in a real-scenario
- Users must use a seed value in order to avoid random sampling errors
